# CSE310-Calculator

# Overview 
This project allowed me to explore the Kotlin language by building a robust and user-friendly calculator application. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, while demonstrating key Kotlin features like variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Kotlin's syntax and functional programming capabilities. Through this project, I aimed to implement best practices in code structure and error handling while showcasing Kotlin's simplicity and power. Additionally, I wanted to create an application that is interactive and easy to use, providing a clear example of Kotlin's strengths as a language.

# Future Work
Add support for more advanced operations like exponentiation, square root, and trigonometric functions.

Enhance user experience by implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Kotlin-based frameworks like JavaFX or Compose for Desktop.

Implement persistent storage to allow users to save and view their calculation history.
